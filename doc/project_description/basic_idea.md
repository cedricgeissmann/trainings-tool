# Trainingstool

## Basic Idea
 - A team organizes its trainings and other events via this homepage. Members of the team can subscribe or unsubscribe for an event.
 - Each team member specifies his personal data (name, address, date of birth, ...) and keeps it up to date.
 - There is a member role who manages all the team members and events
 - For a training there can be added a trainingsplan.

## Login
To use the tool, a member has to login with his account. The member can by identified and can make some user specific actions. To login, the user has to subscribe with a username and a password for the tool.

## Subscribe
The user subscribes with a self chosen unique username and a password (minimum length of 4 letters). During subscription, the user chooses a team and also specifies his personal data. The user is locked after subscription, until the team administrator unlocks him. It is possible to be a member in more than one team, but access is only granted to teams that unlocked the user. To log in the user has to be unlocked in at least one team.

## Subscription and Unsubscription for an event
After the login, the user finds a screen that presents all events he can subscribe or unsubscribe to. The events are ordered chronologically ascending. The user can see other team members that are already subscribed or unsubscribed. The user clicks on the link, and sees his name appear in the desired place immediately.
